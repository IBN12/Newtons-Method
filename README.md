# Newtons-Method
Mathematical Application

Newton’s Method:

Mathematical Project

Mathematical computation implemented with OOD/OOP (Object Oriented Programming).
I used the guessing concept of Newton’s Method in an actual computational program.
The quadratic trinomial is set by default as x^3 – 2x – 5 = 0 as the standard root function. The user must guess the first sequence of the tangent lines x-intercept on the desired standard functions curve. Newton’s method will execute a sequence of approximations until the sequence converges to the root intercept. This means that each sequence is an x-intercept of the tangent getting closer and closer to the root of the curve. 

Newton’s Method Definition: The idea behind Newton’s Method is that the tangent line is close to the curve and so its x-intercept, x_sub_2, is close to the x-intercept of the curve (namely, the root r that we are seeking). Because the tangent is a line, we can easily find its x-intercept.

Each sequence is approximated with the formula x_(n+1)=x_n-(f(x_n))/(f'(x_n))
I will continue to add classes to this program where the user will be able to create their own quadratic trinomials and binomials, while attributing a better understanding of OOD/OOP in detail.
